### 👋 Hi, I'm Dineshkarthik Raveendran (DK).

I build and maintain optimized, scalable and highly available **data pipelines** ingesting data into **Data Lake** & **Data Warehouse** which facilitate deeper analysis, reporting and ML modelling.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on building and improving a configuration-based format for managing complex data pipelines in Airflow - [Declarative Data Pipeline Definition](https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar/techniques?blipid=202005084).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Scala, NLP, and how to [write](https://medium.com/@dineshkarthik.r) occasionally.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on contributing to python based projects and mentoring.
- 🤔 I’m looking for contributions to the [`telegram-media-downloader`](https://github.com/Dineshkarthik/telegram_media_downloader) repository(code, report issues) 
- 💬 Ask me about data science and engineering, learning, and career.
- 📫 How to reach me: [hello@dineshkarthik.me](mailto:hello@dineshkarthik.me)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Never used PyCharm or IntelliJ or any such IDE
